          <p>The amount of employers working remotely today is increasing rapidly every year, and is most likely to increase even more in the future as the urban areas are becoming more and more populated. A survey by Global Workplace Analytics (2015) was made on the population in the U.S where they researched how many people were working from home. Working from home in this survey (telecommuting) means that you spend more than 50% of your work time at home rather than in an office. Since 2005 the work-at-home population has increased by 103% and 6.5% since 2014 reports Global Workplace Analytics (2015). If you compare the increasement of 6.5% from the last year compared to the growth of the employee population (1.8%) the remote working situation is increasing fast. Why are companies integrating remote working as part of their way of communicating? There are many good reasons for both individuals and for the companies to use remote working instead of offices. A research executed by Stanford University has shown that remote workers are 13% more effective and they take less sick days off than workers commuting into their office (Ferguson, 2014). The flexibility and convenience of working from home without commuting is a huge stress relief for many as commuting can be both hectic and demanding. There becomes a fine balance between work and life, where the employees can put more time into their life outside work because they save the time from commuting to work. A good lifestyle in general will result in a better performance and productivity, which the company can take advantage of in the long run. Another advantage is how easy it is to influence the company despite your position. Since all of the communication is performed through the internet people can become more visible and their voices can be heard. On the other hand, this can also be misused and people can take advantage of it to reach their goals. Let’s not forget the massive cost reduction for the company which no longer need to pay rent for an office, electricity bills, heating and in some cases paying for the commute of the workers also.

          So why does many people still have an office, making the effort of commuting into their office every day? One of the biggest contributors to this is the lack of trust between managers and employees, they can never assure themselves that tasks are actually done and it’s easier to monitor the employees and have a visible presence to influence them if they are in the same room. Another major aspect of the situation is how the employees feel disconnected to their managers, and they might feel that they won’t see their performance if they are not present. Most employees think that their performance is based on how many hours they spend in the office rather than the product they deliver according to a survey by O2 (Ferguson, 2014). All type of social interaction between employees and between managers will disappear and it might affect their mental health. Other factors such that computer or network failure can make people travel to work just to be sure they are able to work.</p>
