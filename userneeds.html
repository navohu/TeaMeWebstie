                  <li>The workplace should make people get better in socialising, interacting with other colleagues and bosses. The need of sending messages is for helping people to communicate with each other and to share the parts of the tasks they have done.</li>
                  <li>The workplace should be remote such that the cost, travel and office expenses for the company decreases and efficiency must increase.</li>
                  <li>The application...</li>
                  <li>One of the features of application which will contain list of basic duties of each member.</li>
                  <li>This is another feature of the application which will be for sending notifications and displaying small messages with the purpose of reminding.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>The social need is identified by people becoming less social as remote working is increasing and people are therefore not around other people as much. This is an important skill as almost all projects are based on teamwork where you will need to collaborate. The social skill is very important here in order to create the best possible result.</li>
                  <li>The need of remote working is identified as it requires travel expenses, cost in having offices, electricity and heating.</li>
                  <li>The need for application work on all platforms is identified because it would be better if the application can be installed on all platforms(IOS, Android), so that it can be used by everyone no need to change the communication device or the platform they have.</li>
                  <li>The need to have a to do list in the application is identified because it is obvious to that in a team each member is given a task or the list of the things to do. To have this kind of list will help team members get a balanced allocation of tasks for each employee, and feel more accountable.</li>
                  <li>The reason why this need is identified is todayâ€™s busy lifestyle and so a large number of forgetful people. This will be very useful in involving those workers in the project, as well as helping those ones to be much more connected with their team.</li>
