						<h1>Questionnaire - user 1</h1>
						<h3 class="question">Q1: How did you find the user-interface?</h3>
						<p>A: The user-interface is quite nice and easy to use.</p>


						<h3 class="question">Q2: Were there any visibility problems about the texts or buttons?</h3>
						<p>A: I don’t think I have come across with a visibility problem in your application. The buttons were quite reachable, also the texts on the pages and the page names were readable for usage.</p>


						<h3 class="question">Q3: In your opinion, what is the most interesting part of our application?</h3>
						<p>A: The most interesting part, in my view, is the Tea Room where you actually feel yourself in a room with your colleagues having some tea and chatting meanwhile. I think this is one of the functions which should be added to most of the team applications.</p>


						<h3 class="question">Q4: What is the best thing you liked about our application in terms of functionality or features?</h3>
						<p>A: The feature that you can change your team afterwards even if you selected another team when you logged in. Because a user is not the member of only one team, he/she can be member of several teams. So, the need to log out and log in again in order to select another team to communicate with is a waste of time but nothing. That’s why I think the ability to change between teams from the user page is a great advantage about your application.</p>


						<h3 class="question">Q5: Is there any part of the application which you think would be better if it is changed or improved in some way?</h3>
						<p>A: For me, I think, the addition of users to a team while you are creating a team. Because you don’t actually know the usernames of the users when you are supposed to add some. It would be better if you were provided with the list of all users, or if you were supposed to add their email address instead of username which is more common.</p>

						<h1>Questionnaire - user 2</h1>
						<h3 class="question">Q1: How did you find the user-interface?</h3>
						<p>A: It is really user-friendly, especially the background colours and relevant buttons to each page. </p>

						<h3 class="question">Q2: Were there any visibility problems about the texts or buttons?</h3>
						<p>A: Overall the buttons were comfortable to find and use, and the text sizes and words displayed on the screen were readable. However, there was only one problem about texts which was on user page. So, when I went to the user page, it was a bit difficult for me to read my details. Maybe the colour of the text in the user page or the colour of the background can be changed in order to solve this issue.</p>

						<h3 class="question">Q3: In your opinion, what is the most interesting part of our application?</h3>
						<p>A: The most beautiful thing about TeaMe is TeaRoom for my opinion. It is really cool to have such a virtual room to chat with all the people in your team and talk about the stuff that is not related with job.</p>

						<h3 class="question">Q4: What is the best thing you liked about our application in terms of functionality or features?</h3>
						<p>A: I think, the overall functionality of the application is useful by teams. I mean, in my opinion, the application has the right number of pages not too many or not too less. Also, the features of the pages are the most common things that are needed in team working.</p>

						<h3 class="question">Q5: Is there any part of the application which you think would be better if it is changed or improved in some way?</h3>
						<p>A: Other than the visibility of the details in the user page which I told above, there is nothing need to be changed, from my point of view. </p>
