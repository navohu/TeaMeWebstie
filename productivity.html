					<p class="text-lowercase">According to the study took place in Ctrip travel company, the workers who telecommuted for 9 months were much happier and more productive than the ones who worked in the office atmosphere during this time period. “The results we saw at Ctrip blew me away.” says Nicholas Bloom (2014). Before the experiment began, the company was thinking about the gain in saving money on furniture or space. However, it profited a considerable amount in productivity of employees. So, the people who worked from home replied 13.5% more phone calls than the ones in the office. In addition, quit amount was a half of the office quit rate, and as expected the at-home workers were much more satisfied than the office workers. During the experiment, the employees at home worked more hours that the ones in the office. It includes starting to work earlier, having less amount of break, working till the late hours and etc. However, it is not the only reason of their productivity. As the remote workers job was mainly to deal with telephone calls, or contact with their clients, having a quieter place helped them to manage it in a better way. Having a comfortable home environment, no company restrictions to obey, taking short breaks whenever they want, and being away from the commuting stress made them to become more engaged with their job. In fact, unfortunately it is not the same for all people or for all job types. For this company, remote working experience lead to considerable results might be because it was studied on call center department, and it was easier to work remotely. Nevertheless, some cultural, circumstantial or family factors can worsen the performance rather than improve it. For instance, although older individuals, married people or the workers,who have children to take care at home, prefer working remotely, the younger employees mainly prefer office environment because of their social lives. On the other hand, it also depends on the person whether he/she feels more focused on the work at home or at the workplace (Bloom, 2014).

					The survey done by ConnectSolutions in 2014 shows that the remote working is a good way to increase productivity and motivation of employees. According to the survey, 77 percent of workers supported remote working because of its huge productivity. However, the rest 23 percent were in favour of working in the office circumstances as it helps them to work longer hours. On the other side, additional to the benefits for big companies such as decreasing costs, it is suggested that remote working may be helpful for employees’ healthy lives. As indicated in the survey, 45% remote workers were sleeping better, 35% were doing exercises more and 42% had healthier diets. Also, 53% of participants argued about the stress reduction advantage of remote working. (Sword, 2015) As a result of this survey, we can say that much healthier, less stressed, and more joyful employees means a successful employer, too. So, those workers help their employers by taking the heaviness of the job away much easily, eliminating being absent for the work, and causing higher productivity.

					The research done by recruitment consultant Robert Half shows that during the last 3 years in the UK, the extensiveness in the public sector’s remote working has increased by 47 percent. However, the number in private sector does not fall behind it. According to the researchers, remote working without any physical management or observation does not mean a decline in productivity. It is also revealed that for 60% HR directors in private sector (65% in public sector), given self-management to workers lets them have more flexible time and life, consequently, results in productivity increase. Even though the answers of respondents about productivity of remote working differ because of their lifestyles, thoughts or attitudes towards changes, most of them replied positively about remote working and its good effect on productivity (FM World, 2015).</p>
