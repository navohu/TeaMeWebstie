					<p>Nowadays famous companies tend to have their employees working from home and people prefer working from home rather than working in the office environment because of some reasons. Reducing space, furniture and equipment costs, avoiding time wasted commuting, trying to have a balanced work life integration are included to those reasons. However, as well as the advantages there are some disadvantages that companies like ATOS are concerned about.In particular, the companies that prefer remote working have a few problems related to the engagement so that working remotely reduces the communication between employees and managers and between the workers themselves. Therefore, companies are trying to find a solution to keep their employees connected as well as helping them to work from home. The company we are working with - ATOS is a european IT services company which has headquarters in France and manages its work with a large number of teams of workers by encouraging 75% of all its positions to work remotely. ATOS has some applications such as blueKiwi, SharePoint, Lync, Outlook, Mhub for its teams to function more productive. Although the given programs help the employees to share their documents, videos and message to each other, they fulfill the functions separately. However, a new and more improved application is needed which will contain all the functions to accomplish the group work effectively and allow employees to communicate with each other. In order to fulfill these needs, and satisfy the requirements given by the client, the aim is to create an application with specific name and logo, and which will be a solution to both remote working and socialising of employees.
