            <h1 class="text-center">Technical Achievements</h1>
						<p>The technical achievements we have been going through this term is to master web technologies from frontend to backend. We have mastered many different tasks that none of us had any experience in before. We have been able to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a well functioning app with features such as a chat, posting, sharing feelings etc. 
            To make some of the JavaScript implementation easier we used jQuery which is a JavaScript library that includes many ready built in functions. For the styling of the application we have also managed to use jQuery Mobile, which is strongly connected to jQuery but includes proper CSS files for us to create a consistent look and feel for the app and which goes by the “rules” of a mobile app. The rest of the design is made by hand by us. We have achieved to use a chat API and SDK called PubNub which powers low-latency messaging between any devices.PHP has been used to connect to the database in order to retrieve information, as well as storing and updating information with SQL. To turn the web application into a mobile app we have managed to use Apache Cordova.</p>
